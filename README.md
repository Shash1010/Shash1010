# About me

I am Shashwati H, currently an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. I have a major in biology from IISER Pune. I am doing my Master's thesis in Ashoka University in the economics department. My shift to behavioral economics from biology was fuelled by a curiosity to understand human behavior and a dream to bring about impactful changes to the society we live in. I am currently working on understanding decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Interested in all things human behavior, coding, photography and food.
